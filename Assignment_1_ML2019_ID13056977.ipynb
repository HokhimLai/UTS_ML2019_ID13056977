        "Generative modelling is a new kind of machine learning model classification recently have been heavily developed and applied to the industry. It has been distinguished three major classes by Jebara at around 2004. They are generative learning, discriminative learning and conditional learning. When it comes to 2019, generative model already developed in a well progress and started being applied by technology companies such as DeepMind and NVIDIA for different purposes. It can also apply in other areas, for example, super-resolution, colorization product or realistic samples for artwork.\n",

Among all of them, Fully Visible Belief, Variational Autoencoder and Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are the most popular type of class used in today.

In order to show a completeness analysis, they have used other generative modeling to compare with the main model, GAN.  In the summarized table, researchers compare GAN with other generative model not only one perspective, but in a full way. For example, in order to show the convenience of GAN, table showed  how accessible when it apply on sampling compared with other modeling. Generative autoencoders and Deep undirected graphical models are requires Markov chain, but GAN doesn’t need any requirements on sampling. Using the table not only show the challenges were faced of each generative modeling, it demonstrate the advantage and benefit of GAN when it compare to other model.
